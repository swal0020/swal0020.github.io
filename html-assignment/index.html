        <p>Hi, I'm Matt, and I am currently a student at <em>Algonquin College </em>, taking part in the Interactive Media Design course. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year as a college student and I just graduated from <abbr title="North Grenville District High School">NGDHS</abbr>. Throughout the course, I am hoping to find new skills to help find a job in a more creative field.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about music, both listening and creating, and it helps me guide the day, with different genres based on the time.</p>
