        For me, photography was a way to show a vision and art, without having to be physically artistic. The biggest thing for me was that through my photos, I was able to show what moving into a big city, from a town in the middle of nowhere, was like for me. </p>

      <p>Art became more than just a way to show off cool things for me. It became a way to make the mundane more interesting and the interesting more mundane. Art is, and will always be, within in the eye of the beholder. By being able to present my art to someone, I'm able to see how they react to how I see the average thing.  </p>
